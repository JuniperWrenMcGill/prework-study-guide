        <ul>
          <li> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a fundamental language for constructing webpages.</li>
          <li> The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </l1>
          <li> You can add as many notes within these labeled brackets. </l1>

           <br>
           Headings "&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;,...&lt;h6&gt;" Theese define the level of headings on a page with "&lt;h1&gt;" being the most significant.
           <br>
           Paragraph "&lt;h1&gt;": Represents blocks of text, it is commonly used for textual content.
           <br> 
           List &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &ltli&gt;: These represent unordered and ordered list, providing a way to organize information.
           <br>
           Images &lt;img&gt;: this command contains information about displayed images. The src attribute defines the image source. 
           <br> 
           Line Break &lt;br&gt;: this command creates a line brea, useful for spacing between content blocks.

          <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element </li>
          <li>There are three ways to apply CSS:
           <br>
           Inline CSS: Applied directly in HTML using the style attribute. Quick changes, but less flexible
           <br>
           Internal CSS Style Sheet: Embedded in HTML using the &lt;style&gt; element. Rules apply to specific page elements.
           <br>
           External CSS Style Sheet:Preferred method for most cases. CSS rules kept in a separate file for easier design changes. Linked to HTML using &lt;link&gt; in the &lt;head&gt; </li>
         <li>Steps to link the external CSS file to the HTML using the &lt;link&Gt; element.
            <br>
           1. Open your HTML file in the text editor.
            <br>
           2. Locate the &lt;head&gt; section of the HTML file.
            <br>
           3. Insert the following &lt;link&gt; element after the final &lt;meta&gt; element and before the &lt;title&gt; element:
            <br>
            &lt;link&gt; rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"&gt;</li>

          <li>GitHub Flow:
            <br>
            1. Create a Feature Branch: Start with a feature branch, not directly in the main branch.
            <br>
            2. Make Changes and Commit: Make changes in the feature branch and commit them. Use descriptive commit messages.
            <br>

            <br>
            4. Open a Pull Request (PR): Open a PR to merge the feature branch into the main branch. PR compares your changes (feature branch) with the main branch.
            <br>
            5. Code Review and Approval: Others review your changes, comment, and suggest. Resolve conflicts if any.
            <br>
            6. Merge into Main: Once approved, merge your changes into the main branch. Main branch is now updated with your changes. </li>
         <li>Syncing Local and Remote Branch:
            <br>
            1. Use the command line to go to the project directory.
            <br>
            2. Create Feature Branch: "git checkout -b feature/starter-code", "git add -A", "git commit -m "add starter code", "git pull origin main", "git push origin feature/starter-code",
            <br>
            3. In the browser, go to the GitHub repository. Select the "Compare & pull request" button.
            <br>
            4. Merge PR: Add a title, leave the body empty. Set base branch to "main", comparison branch to "feature/starter-code."" Click "Create Pull Request" and then "Merge Pull Request."

         <li> Some Integrating Basics:
           <br>
           1. Integrating JavaScript into a Project:
           <br>
           • Navigate to the project directory in the command line.
           <br>
           • Ensure you are on the main branch using git checkout main and synchronize with the latest changes using git pull origin main.
           <br>
           • Create a new feature branch with git checkout -b feature/add-js.
           <br>
           • Go to the relevant folder (e.g., assets) and create a new file, for instance, script.js.
           <br>
           • Open the newly created file in your preferred code editor.
           <br>
           2. Creating a JavaScript Variable:
           <br>
           • Declare a variable in the JavaScript file with a meaningful name and assign a value (e.g., var myVariable = "example").
           <br>
           • Utilize console.log(myVariable) to display the variable's value in the console.
           <br>
           • Save the file.
           <br>
           3. Connecting JavaScript File to HTML:
           <br>
           • Open the HTML file and include &lt;script src="./path/to/your/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; under the &lt;footer&gt; and above the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag
           <br>
           • Save the HTML file.
           <br>
           4. Using Browser Developer Tools:
           <br>
           • Open the HTML file in a browser using a development server.
           <br>
           • Access the browser's Developer Tools by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or using keyboard shortcuts.
           <br>
           • Navigate to the Console tab to inspect the output of console.log.</li>
         <li> Overview of Control Flow:
           <br>
           1. Control flow determines the order in which a computer executes code.
           <br>
           2. JavaScript code runs sequentially, from the first statement at the top to the last at the bottom.</li>
